description = "Create Git commits by splitting changes into logical units"

prompt = """
Create Git commits following these rules:
- Follow commit message conventions (add/update/fix/delete/docs/test/merge/init)
- Use subject line only (no commit body)
- Do NOT add Claude or any AI as co-author
- Split changes into appropriate logical units with multiple commits
- Each commit should have a single responsibility
- ONLY korean language is allowed in commit messages

Steps to follow:
1. Check current changes with `git status` and `git diff`
2. Categorize changes into logical units (e.g., feature addition, bug fix, refactoring, style changes)
3. Group files by each logical unit
4. For each group:
   - Stage only the relevant files with `git add <file paths>`
   - Write a concise commit message following the conventions (subject line only)
   - Execute `git commit -m "message"`
5. Verify the results with `git log --oneline -n [number of commits]`

Important:
- Never combine unrelated changes into one commit
- Each commit should be atomic and focused on a single purpose
- Use appropriate prefixes: add (new feature), update (enhancement), fix (bug fix), delete (removal), docs (documentation), test (tests), merge (merge commits), init (initialization)
